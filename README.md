# Logic Box

Well, this is a bit of an "artistic" project of mine. I'm an engineer by the way, but I do think that every complex process have a bit of an artistic component to it.

So, what I want to build is boxes in different colors and theiy could be on or off. A sequential logic circuit written in a JavaScript function will be running in a given discrete time, and each box, as their state is represented by binary variables, can be a logic circuit input, output or inner state. The flashing of the boxes will be a product of the logic circuit activity.

The more complex the sequential logic circuit is, the more interesting!
